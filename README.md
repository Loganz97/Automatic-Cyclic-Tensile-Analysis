# Automatic Cyclic Tensile Analysis

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1jJQlW4wBg_2Gf00Zuq0MDDVkDpR5o60_?usp=sharing)

A Python notebook for automated analysis of cyclic tensile test data from **Instron-generated CSV files**, providing key mechanical properties and generating stress-strain visualizations.

## Features

- Automatic cycle identification and segmentation
- Calculation of mechanical properties:
  - Hysteresis energy
  - Elastic (Young's) modulus
  - Loss coefficient
  - Stress and strain ranges
- Signal-to-noise ratio assessment and automatic smoothing for noisy data
- Customizable stress-strain curve visualization
- Choice of integration methods for hysteresis calculations (Shoelace or Trapezoidal)
- Auto-detection of loading start and automatic column mapping from CSV header

## Input Requirements

The notebook accepts **Instron-generated CSV files** with the following columns:
- Time (s)
- Displacement (mm)
- Force (kN)
- Tensile strain (%)
- Tensile stress (MPa)

*Note: If column names differ slightly, the notebook will attempt to match them automatically.*

## Usage

1. Click the "Open in Colab" badge above  
2. Run all cells using `Runtime > Run all`  
3. Upload your CSV file when prompted  
4. Select your preferred:
   - Integration method (Shoelace or Trapezoidal)
   - Color scale for visualization (Grayscale, Maroon, or Gold)

## Outputs

- Stress-strain plots with cycle-based coloring and large-font labels
- CSV file containing cycle statistics:
  - Signal-to-noise ratio (dB)
  - Hysteresis energy (MJ/mÂ³)
  - Elastic modulus (MPa)
  - Loss coefficient (dimensionless)
  - Stress/strain ranges

## Important Notes

**Note: If any of the cycles in your data have a signal-to-noise ratio of < 13 dB, you need to treat these calculations with caution and independently verify their accuracy.**
